        <h2>About Nature</h2>
        <p>
            Nature which is the most beautiful gift of God given to humankind. It gives us almost all the sources which help humankind to live.
<br>
            The humans have needed to survive, and thrive, which is provided by the natural world around us: food, water, medicine, materials for shelter, and even natural cycles such as climate and nutrients.
    <br>        
            Earth Day seems as good a day as any to remind ourselves what nature gives us free-of-charge. Here then is a selective sampling of nature’s importance to our lives: freshwater, pollination, seed dispersal, pest control, medicines, fisheries, soil health, vast biodiversity & abundant wildlife, climatic regulations, mountains etc.
        <br>    
            Freshwater is the utmost requirement of humankind, without water we cannot survive more than a few days.
            <br>
            In agriculture, pollination is very much required. As the insects, birds and some mammals are also part of our nature, they pollinate the world’s plant. Around 80% of the world’s plants pollinate in this way only. Again, nature does this for us.
<br>
Many plants require other species to move their seeds from parents plant to a new plant which is done by birds, rodents, elephants and bats.
